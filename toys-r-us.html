        <p>Toys "R" Us, a renowned toy and juvenile-products retailer founded in 1948, enjoyed global success with its extensive selection of toys. However, facing financial challenges amid increasing competition from online retailers, the company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2017. Despite efforts to restructure, Toys "R" Us ultimately liquidated its U.S. operations in 2018, marking the end of an iconic era in toy retailing.</p>
